LIVEKIT TURN DETECTOR - QUICK MODE ONLY
========================================

Version: 0.5.0+quickmode
Location: /root/workerv14_grace_rag/custom_packages/livekit-plugins-turn-detector-quickmode

WHAT THIS IS:
-------------
A lightweight, drop-in replacement for livekit-plugins-turn-detector that uses
ONLY punctuation-based detection. NO ML models are loaded at startup.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL:
-------------------------------
✓ NO model loading - instant startup
✓ NO onnxruntime dependency
✓ NO transformers dependency  
✓ NO huggingface-hub dependency
✓ Only requires: livekit-agents

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
Detects end of turn by checking if text ends with: . ! ?
- Returns probability 1.0 if punctuation found
- Returns probability 0.0 if no punctuation
- Supports ALL languages (not just English)
- Zero latency detection

INSTALLATION:
-------------
cd /root/workerv14_grace_rag/custom_packages/livekit-plugins-turn-detector-quickmode
./install.sh

This will:
1. Uninstall the original livekit-plugins-turn-detector
2. Install this quick mode version in its place

UNINSTALL:
----------
./uninstall.sh

Then reinstall original if needed:
pip install livekit-plugins-turn-detector

USAGE:
------
Same as original - it's a drop-in replacement:

from livekit.plugins import turn_detector
model = turn_detector.EOUModel()

WHAT WAS REMOVED:
-----------------
❌ All ML model loading code
❌ ONNX inference code
❌ Transformers tokenizer code
❌ Model download functionality
❌ Config file (not needed - only quick mode)
❌ All heavy dependencies

This is a production-ready, simplified version for users who want fast
startup and don't need ML-based turn detection.
